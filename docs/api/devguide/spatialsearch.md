# Spatial Search for Features

This section describes how to search for specific features in your space which are intersecting with a provided geometry.

## Possibilities to Provide a Geometry for a Spatial Search

A spatial search requires a Geometry as an input. One common use-case: find all Features which are 
around 1000 meters from a given Position. Another one could be: find all Features which are 100 meters
beside a road. 

You can realize that kind of spatial search by providing a Point or LineSting Geometry and a radius, indicated 
in meters, which gets applied to thicken the input Geometry.

Another common usecase is: find all Features which are belonging to a country. Thereto you only need to provide
the Polygon Geometry of the country.  

All [GeoJSON](../concepts/geojsonbasics.md) Geometry 
types are allowed as input [Point, MultiPoint, LineString, MultiLineString, Polygon, MultiPolygon].

### Submitting Geometry via POST Request

The easiest way for providing a search Geometry is submitting it via a POST-Request.  

### Referencing an existing Geometry for a Spatial Search

Another way to provide a search Geometry is to read it from a existing Feature, which is stored in a Data Hub Space
that you have access to. This is recommended if your search Geometry is a really complex one, or if you want to store
frequently used Geometries for spatial searches.

### Extend Spatial Search

You can combine the spatial search requests with defining:

+ *radius* - in meter to thicken the input Geometry
+ *[property search](../devguide/propertiessearch.md)* - add filter based on properties
+ *tag search* - add filter based on tags
+ *selection* - select properties which should exclusively get included in the response 

## Using Spatial GET-Requests

### Request

*Try in [Swagger](https://xyz.api.here.com/hub/static/swagger/#/Read%20Features/getFeaturesBySpatial)*

Spatial-Search by referencing a position (lat,lon) & defining a radius indicated in meters:
```HTTP
GET /spaces/{spaceId}/spatial?lon={Longitude}&lat={Latitude}&radius={raduisInMeters}
```

Spatial-Search by referencing a Feature from a Data Hub Space:
```HTTP
GET /spaces/{spaceId}/spatial?refSpaceId={referencedSpace}&refFeatureId
={referencedFeatureId}
```

### Response

```JSON
{
    "type": "FeatureCollection",
    "features":
    [
        {
            "type": "Feature",
            "id": "BfiimUxHjj",
            "geometry":
            {
                "type": "Point",

                ]
            },
            "properties":
            {
                "name": "Anfield",
                "spaceId@ns:com:here:xyz":

                    [
                        "football",
                        "stadium"
                    ]
                },

                "popupContent": "Home of Liverpool Football Club"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

## Using Spatial POST-Request

### Request

*Try in [Swagger](https://xyz.api.here.com/hub/static/swagger/#/Read%20Features/getFeaturesBySpatialPost)*


Spatial-Search by posting a Geometry:
```HTTP
POST /spaces/{spaceId}
```
with the following body
```JSON
{
	"type": "MultiPolygon",
	"coordinates": [
		[
			[
				[
					7,
					50
				],
				[
					7.1,
					50
				],
				[
					7.1,
					50.1
				],
				[
					7,
					50.1
				],
				[
					7,
					50
				]
			],
			[
				[
					7.05,
					50.05
				],
				[
					7.05,
					50.09
				],
				[
					7.09,
					50.09
				],
				[
					7.09,
					50.05
				],
				[
					7.05,
					50.05
				]
			]
		]
	]
}
```
