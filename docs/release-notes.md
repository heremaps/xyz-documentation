### XYZ Pro Features Beta Release 1.0.1

This rather significant release provides access to exciting new features in the API:

🔎🔎🔎 **Property Search** 🔍🔍🔍

Property Search allows users to filter data by requesting features from the XYZ API based on the values of their properties. Only need buildings taller that 100 feet, or just addresses in one county? The XYZ Hub will automatically track and index these properties as you upload them, making it easy and fast to download just what you need.


You can access property search with -s and operators -- `here xyz show spaceID -s "p.property_name>value"`


Note that in a url, the arguments are `=, !=, =gt=, =gte=, =lt=, =lte=`.


Properties are automatically indexed depending on their count and value.


✂️✂️✂️ **Property Filter** ✂️✂️✂️

We've all been there -- you have a lot of properties in your features. Too many, probably. If only you could somehow... filter them, and only return what you need with your geometry.


We're here for you with `-p` -- even if you have 100 properties, `here xyz show -p p.property1,p.property2` will just return a feature with a geometry and those properties you carefully select.


❇️❇️❇️ **Virtual Spaces** ❇️❇️❇️

Virtual Spaces give users access to multiple spaces with one ID. Group lets you bundle your spaces together, and changes get written back to their original spaces. Associate lets you make your own personal edits to a shared space or one with public data, merging the properties of objects with the same feature ID.


`here xyz virtualize -a|-g space1,space2`


📐📐📐 **Schema Validation** 📏📏📏

Everyone needs validation, and so does your data. Upload a JSON Schema file to describe your data formats and ensure quality data in your XYZ Spaces.


`here xyz create -s schema.json`


⬢⬡⬢ **Hexbins** ⬢⬡⬢

Hexbins are a data simplification method that makes it feasible to visualize large datasets at low zoom levels (continent, country, state/province). A series of hexagon grids are created and the points that fall inside each are counted and written to a new space. These hexagons or their centroids can be quickly displayed in place of the raw data.


Learn more via `here xyz hexbin -h`


Note: reading from and writing to another user's space, and reading via bbox, are works in progress.


🔧🔧🔧 **Space Configuration** 🔧🔧🔧


Behold the new here xyz `config` command which not only lets you get data and statistics about your space, but edit and make changes to space metadata.

`here xyz config spaceID`

`here xyz config spaceID --stats`

### Studio release 0.2.0

This one’s all about the tables! We’ve made improvements to the functionality and performance of our data tables in Studio. 

> TL;DR: While editing a project, the features you see on the map will be the features you see in the table view. Improved performance for inspecting large Spaces in Data Hub.

> Coming soon: account dashboard and improved map performance.

:sparkles: **NEW** :sparkles:

We’ve strengthened the connection between what you see on the map and what you see on the data table. When you are editing a project, the features that are currently visible on the map will be the features available on the table. This will help you narrow down the features you are working with on the table, and will also improve Studio performance.

:hammer: **IMPROVED** :wrench:

We’ve also improved functionality for inspecting your Spaces via the Studio Data Hub.
For Spaces with a smaller number of features, you will continue to be able to search, add columns, delete rows and edit cells.
For Spaces with a large number of features, we’ve introduced pagination and restricted some functionality, which improves the table’s overall performance.

:ant: **FIXED** :ant:

Feature property values are now being saved as the correct type (for example, as a number if it is a number) after edits and for new additions (new columns and new features).

:crystal_ball: **COMING SOON** :crystal_ball:

Account dashboard: a place to manage your plan(s) and check in on your usage.
Improved map performance for large Spaces.

:sparkles: **NEW** :sparkles:

Now you can manage your projects on the go! We’re introducing a new Studio experience for mobile devices. You can view your project dashboard, adjust project settings, and easily view your published maps.

:hammer: **IMPROVED** :wrench:

We’ve also updated the mobile experience for published maps, making it easier to view feature cards alongside the legend panel that was introduced in our last release. 

Our basemap styles have received a polish, and they’re looking spiffy. You’ll see the familiar color themes, but notice enhanced contrast for data visualization, as well as more detailed line work and road hierarchy across zooms. 

As requested, your preference for list view or thumbnail view on the Studio dashboard is now saved.

:ant: **FIXED** :ant:

### Studio and Viewer release 0.1.17
The XYZ Studio team is back with some new features that will help you tell even more compelling stories with your maps!

> TL;DR: You can now add a legend to your published projects! You can also add a title and description. There is a new, easy way to turn cards on or off for published projects.

> Coming soon: improved experience on mobile devices.

:sparkles: **NEW** :sparkles:

At long last, legends! You can now add a legend to your published project, which will show the symbol and name for each style group on your map.  Preview your legend in Publish Settings, and if you like what you see, you can add it right then and there to your project. We hope you’re as excited about this as we are.

_But wait, there’s more_: In Publish Settings, you can also choose to add your project’s title and description to the published version. You can now easily turn off cards completely for your published project. If the Cards option is not selected in Publish Settings, feature information cards will not be shown at all in your published project. If you select the Cards option, they will show on click, with an option to view on hover, in your published project.
You probably did not need that explanation of how checkboxes work.

:hammer: **IMPROVED** :wrench:

You can now create style groups based on `>= (greater than or equal to)` or `<= (less than or equal to)` conditions. This improvement is guaranteed to make your new style groups >=  all your previous styles. Style group symbols in the Studio side panel now more closely match the symbols on your map, rather than simply indicating feature type and color. Fancy!

:ant: **FIXED** :ant:

An error that would occasionally be shown during the file upload process, despite a successful upload, has been fixed.
Style groups based on Feature ID are now rendering correctly on published maps. Other minor bug fixes.


:crystal_ball: **COMING SOON** :crystal_ball:

In our next release, we’ll be introducing an improved mobile experience. You’ll be able to log into Studio, view your projects, and access Publish Settings for your projects.

### Studio and Viewer release 0.1.16
We are ringing in the new year with some exciting new features in Studio! We’re also trying out a new format for release notes, with the hope that it will be easier to understand the improvements and fixes in each release, and how they impact your use of Studio. Let us know what you think!

> TL;DR: Create style groups to style data according to property values. Drag and drop a file to the map to begin uploading the file for use in that project.

> Coming soon: options to display the project title, description, and legend in published maps.

:sparkles: **NEW** :sparkles:

You now have the ability to style the data on your map according to feature property values!

Where you once could adjust the style of the features on your map as a single group, there is now an option to add a new point/line/polygon style. This button opens a popup where you can define a style group.

You can also create a new group by clicking on a feature on the map, and then clicking the paint roller icon next to a property value in the sidebar. This will create a new group based on that property value, and you can always customize it further.

:world_map: *Example:* Say you are working with a building dataset, and there is a `“year_built”` property. You could create a style group for features where `“year_built”`  is greater than 1990. All features in the dataset where the building was built after 1990 would be included in the style group, and you can easily highlight these features on your map.

You can add on to rules using the “and” button to further filter the features included in the group.

:world_map: *Example:* Using the building dataset example from above, let’s say there is also a property called `“frame_material”`. You could also click the “and” button to add `“frame_material equals wood”`, to include only wood-frame buildings built after 1990 in the group.

To adjust or delete a group, click the gear icon next to the group name in the feature styling interface.

When you have multiple style groups within a feature type (points, lines or polygons), you can adjust the order of appearance on the map by dragging the rule group up or down in the styling interface.

You can now drag and drop a file to the map in a project to begin uploading the file for use in that (and other) projects.

Dragging a dropping a file to the map will open the “Add data” interface, and once your file is done uploading, it will be auto-selected to add to your project— you just need to click the “Add 1 dataset” button.

:crystal_ball: **COMING SOON** :crystal_ball:

We will soon be releasing new functionality that will provide the option to display a project’s title, description, and legend information in the published map. It will be a great way to help you tell a story through your map, and will show off all the cool new style groups you’ve created.
