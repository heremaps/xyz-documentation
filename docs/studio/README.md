### Before you contribute

As part of filing a pull request we ask you to sign off 
the [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/) (DCO) 
The DCO is necessary mainly because you own the copyright to your changes, 
even after your contribution becomes part of our
codebase, so we need your permission to use and distribute your code.
Coordinating up front makes it much easier to avoid frustration later on.

See https://github.com/apps/dco to learn how you can sign off your commits.

### Content reviews
