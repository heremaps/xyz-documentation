## Create datasets

### Upload datasets

You can upload datasets from your computer for use in HERE Studio by adding them
onto the map.

Click the **+ Add** button and select one or multiple files
from the system file selection dialog.

You can also _drag and drop_ files directly onto the map. They
will be uploaded and added to the map automatically.

### Pick datasets

One of the benefits of having your dataset in the Data Hub in the cloud
is to use them in more than one map. You can pick data from the list
of available datasets and them to you map project.

Data is then shared between all map projects and changes to the data are
reflected in each map project immediate.

> #### Note
>
> Data and style are handled separately. All data is stored in the Hub
> but each project can define different styles even for the same data.
> You can also safely rename layers individually without breaking the
> link to the dataset.

### Add empty layer

From the same dialog, you can also add an empty layer if you don't have any
file data. Then you can then create and edit features as described below.

## Feature and table view

You can look at and change the data content available for individual
features by selecting them on the map. This shows a form to the left of the
map with the values (and they keys).

The map is great to see data in it's geographic location. But sometimes you
need to see the data in a _table_ to understand the content.
You can also change the data content, sort and look for data and add
additional columns.

> #### Note
>
> The table shows data from one layer or dataset. You might have to
> select the layer you want to see before you can switch to the table view.
