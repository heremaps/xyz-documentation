# Navigate

In this section, we'll explain the main _Dashboard_ with the _Project_ and _Data Hub_ tabs and describe the available options. Then we will review a project and learn how to navigate between _Layers_ as
well as different views, such as _Map_ view and _Data_ view. 

## Dashboard

### Projects

The dashboard is the main landing page after you log in and 
shows you a overview of all your projects. It contains a summary of
your project with its settings and a small thumbnail of the map. You can also determine if it has been published.

If you have several projects, organizer 
functions appear that help you get an overview or search.

### Data Hub

The **Data Hub** lists all datasets you can access and use directly
in projects. You can narrow down the list by _searching_ for a specific dataset and upload data as a new dataset.

You can also manage your data, upload new datasets, edit entries, delete complete datasets and download a file of the content stored in the cloud.

## Project

### Map View

You can navigate the map using the mouse, changing the view
by _dragging_ the map and using the _zoom control_ (or the mouse wheel) to zoom nearer or father away from the map. You can also **search** for cities and places by using the search bar.

### Map Bookmarks

As your map becomes larger and the data more complex, you can  _switch_ between different pre-defined map views. In each
project you can define your own **location bookmarks** and switch 
between them.
