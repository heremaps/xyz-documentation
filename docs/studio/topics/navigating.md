# Navigate

When you start exploring, it's always good to know your way around first
so that you always find your way back.

In this section, we'll start on the main _Dashboard_ with the _Project_ and
_Data Hub_ tabs and the options you find there.

Then we look at the one project and see how to navigate between _Layers_ as
well as different views, like _Map_ view and _Data_ view. 

## Dashboard

### Projects

The dashboard is the main landing page after you log in and it
shows you a overview of all your projects. You see at a glance a summary of
your project with its settings and a small thumbnail of the map. You also 
see if it has been published already.

If you have a lot of projects, you will also see a couple of organizer 
functions that help you quickly get an overview or find what you're looking
for.

### Data Hub

The **Data Hub** lists all datasets you can access and use directly
in projects. You can narrow down the list by _searching_ for a specific
dataset. You can also upload data as a new dataset.

You can also manage your data, upload new datasets, edit entries, delete complete datasets and of course download a file of the content stored 
in our cloud.

## Project

### Map View

You can quickly navigate around the map using the mouse, changing the view
by _dragging_ the map and using the _zoom control_ (or the mouse wheel) to
quickly zoom nearer or father away from the map. You can also **search** for cities and places by using the search bar.

### Map Bookmarks

As your map becomes bigger and the data more complex it is often the case 
that you need to _switch_ between different pre-defined map views. So in each
project you can define you own **location bookmarks** and quickly switch 
between them.
