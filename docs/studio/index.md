## Create a project

Next you probably want to work on your map project. When you first sign in
you won't see any projects, so now is the time to create one.

You should give your map a good name and also a description, in case you forget later what you wanted to show.

You can also pick a basemap - the background on which _your_ map will be drawn. There are a number of themes available (and more will be coming).
Simply select one you like best for your project.

## Create your content

To make your own map involves putting your content on top of it. That
means you need a place to store that content. 
This place is often called a _Layer_ and it can contain many _Points_, _Lines_ and 
_Polygons_ (they are collectively called _Features_ ) that can be colored
and styled. This way your map highlights what you want to show where you want to show it.

Think of a _Layer_ as a transparent sheet that covers the whole world which
you can draw on. Let's draw a small map for a local treasure hunt:

## Load other content

An extremely powerful feature of Here Studio is that you do not have to create all
the content yourself. A lot of open map data can be found on the web already
when you search for it. 

`GeoJSON` is a very common format for geospatial data. If you find something 
you like you can quickly _upload_ this data into Here Studio and turn such a static 
file into a real live map you can change and update at any time.

For example you might want to highlight all the [**bike paths**](https://data.sfgov.org/Transportation/Bikeway-Network/4jy4-tbju) for the treasure hunt:

## Share the map

There is a lot more you can do on the map, but let's assume you are in a
hurry to send an invite to the treasure hunt to your friends because it's
already tomorrow.

You can quickly get an interactive link to your map that can be easily
shared via email, twitter or any messenger app. All you need to do is turn
on publishing and copy the URL to _Your Map_.

!!! tip
    Remember that you can share this map right now and still continue to 
    work on it and make changes. No need to send a new URL - everybody will
    always see the most up-to-date map.
