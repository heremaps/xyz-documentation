HERE Data Hub is an open, interoperable and real-time location data management service from HERE Technologies
that offers simple APIs, SDKs, components, and interactive tools
that enable everyone to make maps easier and faster.

At its heart HERE Data Hub is a collection of tools and APIs to enable everyone to easily
manage map data and build great maps. It is built around standards like
[GeoJSON](http://geojson.org/) and designed to be **open** and **interoperable**
with many other offerings. Most important of all, HERE Data Hub offers
real-time **live** interaction with location data.

It's built from the ground up with productivity in mind. We have taken code and concepts used internally at
[HERE Technologies](https://www.here.com/) for years in some of the most demanding
projects and want to share that with the community of developers, cartographers and
enthusiasts to enable everyone to build better maps.

## Quick start

The easiest way to get started is to have a look at easy to use the **[HERE Studio](https://studio.here.com/)** web application to build and publish maps. Give it a try, it's completely free and open to use for everyone - you only need a HERE Account. Have a look at our
**[documentation](studio/topics/index.md)** for find out more about it.

When you have a GeoJSON file you just want to have a look at without building a full map, check out our open **[GeoJSON Tool](cli/viewer-tool/index.md)** tool. It's a great way to inspect data you'd want to work with.

If you are a developer and want to use our cloud services, you need an `appId`,
which you can get for free from the **[HERE Developer Portal](https://developer.here.com/)**.
See our **[getting started guide](getting-started.md)** for more details.

Then, install the latest version of our CLI with `npm`:

``` sh
npm install -g @here/cli
```

## What to expect

* Powerful **map data management** and **display tools** that make working with
  map data convenient and effective. The tools are easy to understand even if
  you have no prior experience with geospatial, location or projections concepts.

* A free **cloud service** to store and access data for your maps with
  straightforward **RESTful API** calls and a flexible **CLI**. The choice
  is yours. It also gives you access to a wide variety of free and open datasets.

* **UI components** that make it easy to **show and style data** and content exactly how
  you want to see it. It works well with huge amounts of data and also enables
  **rich interactive** and **real-time** experiences.

For detailed instructions on the prerequisites see our **[getting started guide](getting-started.md)**.
