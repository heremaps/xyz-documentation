### Before you contribute
Before we can use your code, you must sign the
[HERE Contributor License Agreement](https://gist.github.com/heremaps-bot/dcb932a07b424f8ed68341054e7e3a53)
(CLA), which triggers automatically when you make a pull request. 
The CLA is necessary mainly because you own the
copyright to your changes, even after your contribution becomes part of our
codebase, so we need your permission to use and distribute your code. We also
need to be sure of various other things -- for instance that you'll tell us if
you know that your code infringes on other people's patents.
Coordinating up front makes it much easier to avoid
frustration later on.

### Code reviews
All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use Github pull requests for this purpose.
