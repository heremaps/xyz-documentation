# Interact with your data

It's very easy to interact with data that get shown by adding an event listener to the `display`.
Here we're going to change the style of the feature that the user clicks on so that it highlights
in a different color.

1. Define the style to use for the highlight
```javascript
var clickedFeature;
// Define new line style
var selectedStyle = [{
    zIndex: 0,
    type: "Line",
    opacity: 0.7,
    strokeWidth: 16,
    stroke: "#FFFFFF"
}];
```

2. Then remember which feature is (or was clicked) so that it can revert to the normal style when
antoher is selected
```javascript
var clickedFeature;
```

3. Finally, add an event listener function to the `display` to fire when the mouse button is released
 revert the previous selection back to normal. If a feature was actually selected `ev.target` will
 contain it, and this can be used set it to the highlight style.
```javascript
// add event listener to pointerup
display.addEventListener('pointerup', function(ev){
	// Restore default feature style
	if(clickedFeature)
		linkLayer.setStyleGroup(clickedFeature);

	// If a feature is clicked
	if(ev.target){
		clickedFeature = ev.target;

		// Set new feature style if mouse clicks on a feature
		linkLayer.setStyleGroup(clickedFeature, selectedStyle);
	}
});
```
