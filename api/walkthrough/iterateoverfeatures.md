# Iterate over Features

!!! Note "The endpoint for the API is https://xyz.api.here.com/hub"

Iterating over features is different from search in two ways:

1. The results are ordered, no features are returned twice.
2. Searches can be continued over several requests.

Sometimes your search will have a lot of features as a result. But the limit you explicitly set or the default limit will only return some of them. In this case, a root attribute **handle** is set in the response. The search can then be continued with the next feature in line by adding the value of the **handle** response attribute as a **handle** query parameter to the request.

## Request

*Try in [Swagger](https://xyz.api.here.com/hub/static/swagger/#/Read_Features)*

GET /spaces/{spaceId}/iterate?tags=&limit=2&handle=2
