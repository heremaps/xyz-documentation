# Namespaces

Namespaces are used to group objects unambiguously, so they can be addressed without confusion. They are used in several areas like XML and Object-oriented programming, to name a few.

## Example

### Request

*Try in [Swagger](https://xyz.api.here.com/hub/static/swagger/#/Edit_Features)*

```HTTP
PUT /spaces/{spaceId}/features?addTags=mountain,canada
```

with the following body

```JSON
{
    "type":"FeatureCollection",
    "features":
    [
	    {
	    	"type":"Feature",
	    	"properties":
	    	{
	    		"name":"Baldy Mountain"
	    	},
	    	"geometry":
	    	{
	    		"type":"Point",

When you upload a feature to XYZ Hub, we automatically add a property *@ns:com:here:xyz* to it. The following information is recorded in this property:

+ *createdAt* - date and time the feature was created in milliseconds since 01.01.1970
+ *updatedAt* - date and time the feature was updated in milliseconds since 01.01.1970
+ *space* - random unique space ID, created at space creation, a string
+ *tags* - the tags you added to the space, an array of strings

We use the namespace to store the additional information in the object without interfering with the properties you provided.
