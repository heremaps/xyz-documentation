## Create datasets

### Upload datasets

You can upload datasets from your computer for use in XYZ by adding them 
onto the map.

One way is to click the **+ Add** button and select one or multiple files
from the system file selection dialog. 

If you want you can also _drag and drop_ files directly onto the map. They
will be uploaded and added to the map automatically.

### Pick datasets

One of benefits of having your dataset in the XYZ Data Hub in the cloud 
is to use them in more than one map. You can pick a data from the list
of available datasets and them to you map project.

Data is then shared between all map projects and changes to the data are
reflected in each map project immediate.

!!! note 
    Data and style are handled separately. All data is stored in the Hub
    but each project can define different styles even for the same data.
    You can also safely rename layers individually without breaking the link
    to the dataset.

### Add empty layer

From the same dialog you can also add an empty layer if you don't have any 
file data. Then you can then create and edit features as described below.

## Feature and table view

You can look at and change the data content available for individual 
features by selecting them on the map. This shows a form to the left of the
map with the values (and they keys).

The map is great to see data in it's geographic location. But sometimes you
really need to see the data in a _table_ to understand the content. 
You can also change the data content, sort and look for data and add 
additional columns.

!!! note
    The table shows data from one layer or dataset. You might have to 
    select the layer you want to see before you can switch to the table view
